I like the idea that after death you can still look around and realize what a dumb shit you are
Todo:
Crafting --> This requires a UI, or commandline input
Secrets --> like ruins and shit --> I can get people to do this probably 

Maybe:
Twilight band on planets
Angering the environment 
portal travel amoung other things increases difficulty // messes with rules of game
