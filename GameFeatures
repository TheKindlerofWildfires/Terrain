I like the idea that after death you can still look around and realize what a dumb shit you are
Todo:
Crafting --> This requires a UI
Secrets --> like ruins and shit
Failure state --> Death by suit power runout. 

Maybe:
Twilight band on planets
Angering the environment 
portal travel amoung other things increases difficulty // messes with rules of game
